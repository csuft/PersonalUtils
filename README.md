# Open Code Base for Daily Development

## Introduction
Currently, I am interested in Multimedia processing and realtime/offline rendering techs. I have always been learning basic theories on these fields and I want to make it my lifetime career. To save me from daily recreation, I created this repo and will keep it updated.
This repo contains several code snippets for daily development ranged from Multimedia processing (H.264/H.265) to Image processing(including realtime rendering) libraries such as OpenGL, OpenCV and etc. Besides, many small utility functions are also adopted in the project. 
The project is managed with CMake and I tried to make it compiled across platform.

## Description
- **ffmpeg**: mainly related to the application of ffmpeg library.
- **opengl**: the startup framework for OpenGL project.
- **opencv**: project template for daily use.
- **windows**: small helpful utilities for Windows programming
- **docs**: simplify terminology concepts.
- **image**: image processing algorithms

## How to compile
- clone the whole projet using **git**
- generate Visual Studio projects with **CMake**
- compile and test
